This study explores the **neurobehavioral toxicity** resulting from the combined exposure of **micro/nanoplastics (MNPs)** and **triphenyltin (TPT)** in **marine medaka (*Oryzias melastigma*)**. Given the increasing concern over MNPs in aquatic environments, the study examines their interaction with organic pollutants like TPT and their **combined toxicological effects**.

By exposing marine medaka larvae to polystyrene MNPs (PS-MNPs), TPT, and their combination, the research assesses impacts on **swimming behavior, neurodevelopment, gene expression, and biochemical markers**. Results indicate that **co-exposure to MNPs and TPT significantly increases neurotoxicity**, as reflected in altered locomotor activity, disrupted neural signaling, and changes in gene expression associated with neurodevelopment. The study also highlights **differences in toxicity between microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs)**, with NPs demonstrating greater penetration and exacerbated toxic effects.

These findings provide **valuable insights into the risks of plastic pollution and chemical contaminants** in aquatic ecosystems and emphasize the need for further research on **synergistic toxic effects in marine organisms**.
